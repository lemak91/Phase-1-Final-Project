# Phase-1-Final-Project-PunkAPI-BeerList

PunkAPI is a free API with a list of various different types of beers and data about them.

In this project I access this API by using fetch and event listeners to grab the information about the beers.

In the JS file there's use of array iteration and DOM manipulation to add elements to the doc.
